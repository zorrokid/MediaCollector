# MyBasicJetpackComposeApp

Android app to get to familiar with Android app development with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

The goal of this project is to build a good basic structure of a Jetpack Compose app backed with Firebase services.

The second goal is to use this as a base on my hobby mobile app projects.

I've been experimenting building mobile apps with Flutter earlier and been wanting to get into native Android side of things with Jetpack Compose so here we go.

This is very much inspired by the following article and example app and codelab:
- https://firebase.blog/posts/2022/05/adding-firebase-auth-to-jetpack-compose-app/
- https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/build-android-app-with-firebase-compose

# Authentication and data storeage

Unsing [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) authentication and Firestore database.

# User Interface

Using [Compose Material 3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-material3).

# Dependency Injection

Using [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for dependency injection.
